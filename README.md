##  Project Introduction
In the educational context, Interactive visualization can help learners to simulate and observe the relationship between multiple variables. While teachers often use interactive visualizations as a hook to engage learners in a lecture, we think that interactive visualizations could also be leveraged in formative assessments. Interactive visualizations can provide precious hands-on opportunities or evaluate procedural skills often ignored in standardized tests. 

However, although there are some interactive visualizations for instructors online, we found that few tools can integrate assessment and interactive visualizations. As a result, when teachers want to authorize assessments with interactive visualizations, they might need to build their questions in tools like google forms and send students the link to the visualization. Students have to frequently switch between the visualization to see the questions in google forms and try to solve them on the visualization, which causes extraneous cognitive load that does not benefit learning.Therefore, we decided to develop a platform that integrates interactive visualization and assessments.
